# Abyssmith

An Obsidian plugin template built for agent-driven development. Clone this repository, tell your agent what to build, and development starts immediately. Skills, hooks, and quality gates come already wired in.

## What makes this different

**Real Obsidian runs in CI.** Every push builds the plugin and launches it inside an actual Obsidian instance on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, plus the real Android app on a device emulator. Each run confirms the plugin genuinely loads.

**The template is agent-native.** Skills, project instructions, and lifecycle hooks are pre-wired for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi. They enforce this project's pnpm-only policy automatically and run the full verification gate before an agent claims a branch complete.

**Every release ships fully verified.** Strict TypeScript, a complete lint, type, test, and build gate run before every push; commits themselves just lint and format the staged files, so edits stay fast. The release command bumps the version only after the plugin passes its full local suite and the real-Obsidian end-to-end tests.

**One command finishes setup.** `pnpm install` wires up git hooks and every agent's configuration together.

## Get started

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then tell your agent what you're building.
