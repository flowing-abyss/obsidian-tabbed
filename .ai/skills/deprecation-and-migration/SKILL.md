description: Manages deprecation and migration for changes to an external or persisted contract — settings/data format, public API or command, or a user-facing feature that needs a compatibility path. Not for internal refactoring, renaming, or dead-code removal with no external contract change.

# Deprecation and Migration

## Where this sits in the workflow

This skill is an entry point parallel to `skill:brainstorming` for removal- or
migration-shaped requests — it is not an alternative to `skill:brainstorming` and
`skill:writing-plans`, and it does not go straight to implementation.

```text
removal or migration request
→ deprecation-and-migration (this skill: contract analysis and migration constraints)
→ brainstorming (design approval, using this skill's output as input)
→ writing-plans
→ implementation
→ verification
```

Use this skill first to answer the five questions below. Then hand that to
`skill:brainstorming` as the input for design approval, same as any other
spec input — do not skip straight from this skill's decision to writing code.

## When to use

Only when the change touches an external or persisted contract:

- the format of persisted settings or plugin data (`data.json`)
- a public API or command this plugin exposes (other plugins or the
  command palette depend on it)
- a user-facing setting or feature that needs a compatibility path so
  existing users aren't broken by the change
- a dependency/API migration that affects stored data or user-visible behavior

**Not this skill:**

- removing internal dead code
- private refactoring with no external contract change
- renaming an internal function
- swapping an implementation while keeping the same external contract
- deleting an unused file

## The five questions

Answer all five before handing off to `skill:brainstorming`:

1. **What contract or persisted data is changing?** Name it exactly (a
   settings field, a command id, a public method).
2. **What could already depend on the old form?** Existing users' saved
   settings, other plugins calling this one, community themes/snippets
   relying on a DOM class or CSS variable.
3. **Does this need an automatic migration, or a compatibility fallback?**
   If old data needs transforming, when does that run (on load)? If old
   behavior needs to keep working for a while, what's the fallback?
4. **What happens on rollback?** If the user reverts to an older plugin
   version after this ships, does their data still load?
5. **When is it safe to remove the old form?** What has to be true first
   (a released version where the new form has existed for at least one
   version, so a rollback within that window still works)?

## Principles

- **Never silently lose persisted user data.** A settings/data migration
  that can't be applied cleanly must fail loudly (a clear error/Notice),
  not drop fields or reset to defaults without telling the user.
- **A separate compatibility period is the default**, and is required when
  any of these hold: safe rollback to an older plugin version is an
  explicit requirement, external consumers exist (other plugins, community
  themes/snippets), or the old form needs to keep working across more
  than one release. In that case, add the new form and migrate/fall back
  first; remove the old form only in a later, separate change.
- **Migrating and removing in the same change is acceptable when all of
  these hold:** the old persisted format is reliably recognized (never
  silently misread as the new one), the migration is covered by a test,
  no user data is lost, there are no external consumers, rollback
  implications were explicitly considered (and are acceptable), and a
  separate compatibility release genuinely adds no practical value for
  this change. Decide this per plugin and record the reasoning in the
  design/plan — this isn't a default to reach for casually.
- **Old settings either load correctly or fail with a clear, actionable
  error** — never a silent partial load or a confusing crash.
- **Every migration has a testable rollback, or the irreversibility is
  explicitly documented and the user is told before it happens.** There's
  no telemetry and no way to check "how many users are on the old
  version" — decide the removal timeline from release versions, not usage data.

## Verification

- [ ] The five questions above are answered, not skipped
- [ ] A test loads data/settings in the OLD format and confirms it either
      migrates correctly or fails with a clear, actionable error — not a
      silent partial load
- [ ] If migration and removal ship in the same change, the design/plan
      explicitly records why (all six conditions above hold) — otherwise
      the destructive step is a separate, later change
- [ ] Rollback behavior (old plugin version reading new-format data) was
      considered and is either safe or explicitly documented as unsafe
